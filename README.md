### Description

I made Auto File Copy to do a auto backup of a folder and subfolders twice a day to me USB drive, and only copy the new and modified files. All setting is stored in the registry. At 16:55 you can backup 5 GIG’s and only copy the files that have changes.

Enjoy and please leave comments and a vote if you like it. Thanks to the two submissions that I borrowed code from (mentioned in code)

The zip has been replaced with corrected code.
